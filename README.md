<b>Abstract</b>:
Our group is interested in how climate change has impacted countries around the world economically and in terms of development. Our research questions include:
How do climate disasters impact gdp/capita, and if/how this relationship changes with the frequency of nature of the observed climate disasters?

How have climate disasters impacted country development with regards to economic growth, well being indicators, and/or agricultural production: what patterns are observed between development indicators and climate change?

Overall, we are interested in showing what climate indicators appear to impact economic development and population well-being and to do this we'll be using the =World Bank and EM-DAT data further detailed below.

<b>Data</b>:
We would need country-level data containing GDP periodically (per year, per month, something longitudinal in nature) from an international orgazation such as the World Bank. We would also need a record of climate disasters along with location, type, and dates of the events, as well as longitudinal data on country development factors. We might also want some data on non-climate related disasters to inform our research on whether or not our findings might be impacted by man-made disasters (e.g., wars).

World Bank: Data on world development indicators (e.g., access to electricity, irrigated land, etc.). Intended to be used to examine how climate disasters coincide with changes in country-level development.

World Bank: General portal for climate change data and topics from the world bank. Includes data on green house gas emissions and agricultural land details (e.g., cerial yield, arable land, co2).

EM-DAT: Data of disasters worldwide since 1900. Includes type of disaster, a record of when it happened, when the records were last updated, where the events happened, etc. They also include certain subgroups that may be used to indicate compounded nature. If an earthquake caused ground shaking and a subsequent tsunami, this may be counted as one disaster that resulted in two subtypes of disaster.
